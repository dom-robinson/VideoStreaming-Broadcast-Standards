          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Technology Maturity Field

The `maturity` field allows you to indicate the development stage of a technology. This enables future features like color coding and filtering based on technology maturity.

#### Maturity Levels (Recommended Values)

- **`"mature"`** - Well-established, widely adopted, stable technology (e.g., H.264, MP4)
- **`"stable"`** - Production-ready, actively used in industry (e.g., HLS, DASH)
- **`"emerging"`** - Growing adoption, becoming mainstream (e.g., AV1, WebRTC)
- **`"experimental"`** - Early development, limited adoption (e.g., new protocols)
- **`"deprecated"`** - Being phased out, legacy support only (e.g., MP3, older protocols)
- **`""`** - Not yet classified (current default)

#### Example Usage

```json
{
  "name": "H.264/AVC",
  "description": "Widely adopted video codec...",
  "maturity": "mature",
  "links": [...],
  "searchTerms": [...]
}
```

#### Future Features

The maturity field will enable:
- **Color coding**: Different shades based on maturity level
- **Visual indicators**: Icons or borders showing maturity status
- **Filtering**: Show/hide technologies by maturity level
- **Timeline tracking**: Track how protocols evolve over time

## üîß Step-by-Step Editing Guide

### 1. Adding a New Technology

To add a new technology to an existing category:

1. **Find the right category** in the JSON file
2. **Add a new technology object** in the `technologies` array:

```json
{
  "name": "Your New Technology",
  "description": "A clear, concise description of what this technology does, its key features, and where it's used. Include technical details like latency, bandwidth requirements, or compatibility.",
  "maturity": "",
  "links": [
    {
      "text": "Official Documentation",
      "url": "https://official-docs.com"
    },
    {
      "text": "Specification",
      "url": "https://specification-url.com"
    }
  ],
  "searchTerms": ["technology", "keyword1", "keyword2", "related", "terms"]
}
```

### 2. Adding a New Category

To add a new category to a layer:

1. **Find the right layer** in the JSON file
2. **Add a new category object** in the `categories` array:

```json
{
  "id": "your-category-id",
  "name": "Your Category Name",
  "description": "Description of what this category covers",
  "keyOrganizations": [
    {
      "name": "Organization Name",
      "description": "What this organization does in this area"
    }
  ],
  "researchAreas": [
    "Current research topic 1",
    "Emerging trend 2",
    "Industry focus area 3"
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "text": "Industry Report",
      "url": "https://report-url.com"
    }
  ],
  "technologies": [
    // Your technologies go here
  ]
}
```

### 3. Updating Existing Information

1. **Find the specific field** you want to change
2. **Edit the value** while maintaining the JSON structure
3. **Keep the formatting consistent** with existing entries

### 4. Adding a New Layer

To add a completely new layer:

1. **Add a new layer object** to the `layers` array:

```json
{
  "id": "your-layer-id",
  "name": "YOUR LAYER NAME",
  "subtitle": "Brief Description",
  "description": "Detailed description of what this layer does and why it's important.",
  "keyFunctions": [
    "Primary function 1",
    "Primary function 2",
    "Primary function 3"
  ],
  "categories": [
    // Your categories go here
  ]
}
```
